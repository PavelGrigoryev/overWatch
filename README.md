### What can this application do:

* Through a telegram bot, you can get the current price for cryptocurrency via the coinlore api
* You can also subscribe to changes in the current cryptocurrency price by 0.01 %
* The bot will notify you about the change in the price of your cryptocurrencies every minute
* You can also view all your notifications, and if you need, to unsubscribe from them
* Also, through the numbers api in the telegram bot, you can get a random fact about the significant date of today
